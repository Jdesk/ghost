# ghost
#localized ghost docker machine - I was hung up on virtual box - but docker has officially caught my attention. 
**so has ghost** simple - blogging platform - ultra customizable - i'm hung on wordpress still, worcamp usa is coming to philly - yes I'll be there volunteering,  drupal is not hard - I find it simpler than wordpress - enough opinion though:
**for simplicity sake, ghost ain't so bad and running locally with docker - commit to git - then cloning to a live environment**
**is super easy.  Get your paths right locally - docker-machine for mac is awesome - use terminal to make changes -
and get your develop on.**
